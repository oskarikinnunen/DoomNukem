in walltoolrooms change list push to push into mesh list instead of entity
add savechunk and loadchunk calls for world meshlist
write initialization for t_meshes, (add primitive_tri.obj to assets, might not be needed tho, the generated triangle way of doing it is fine too)
make world.c render t_mesh objects
