Level editor
	!! Make icons for "[C]create node" "[X]delete node" and display accordingly
	!! make area detailed booleans available from editor (dropdown)
	notes
	save lightmap to file
	put edges/walls/floors in stack
	snap edges in room_init

load/save different world (file selector)
	single file
	fix room save (actually read the room)

component/gun struct saving:
	hardcoded presets, option to save a raw struct but those will immediately be deleted when structanalyzer detects a change in the headers
	raw structs use only read/write, no attempt at realigning memory
	

maybe / later:
	snap toggle
	ramps/stairs
	connect areas (combine height)

Preset editor (assign behaviour to an object)
	audiosource
	light
	npc
	interactable(health pack, new gun, open door, keycard etc.)

memory leaks

actually implement playmode

particles (sprites)
	multiple sprite (only for compliance, not an actual feature that's used)

player behaviour
	fake 3d collision (2d with extra steps)
	shooting hurts enemies and enemies hurt player (raycast and some kind of health system)

AI
	navmesh (subdivide triangle into point grid)
	A* algorithm for pathfinding
	state machine for behaviour
		think of more detailed behaviour for each state
